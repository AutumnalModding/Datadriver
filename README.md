# Datadriver
Templates are [here](https://github.com/RPMYT/Datadriver-Templates/tree/main).

This mod does not provide any content by itself, nor any templates. (Templates might be included in a future update though!)

Currently only supports Forge 1.7.10, though 1.12.2 (Forge), 1.16.5 (Forge/Fabric), 1.18.2 (Forge/Fabric), and 1.19.2 (Forge/Fabric) are planned.
